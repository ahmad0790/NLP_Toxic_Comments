# NLP_Toxic_Comments
Deep Learning Models (CNNs, LSTMs) trained over Toxic Comment Data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) using Keras in Python. Special thanks to David Cheng. 

toxic_comment_final.py has the final models and hyperparameters tuned. experiments.py runs additional experiments to find good hyperparameter choices. Report summarizes model performance and parameter tuning.
